# mohaa-server-setup

## Usage
To create a MOHAA server using my script, you need to follow these steps:
1. Install 'docker' as well as 'docker compose'
2. Decide on one of the tags on [Appelpitje's Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/appelpitje/mohaa-server/tags).
3. Download and edit the [setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slowptr/mohaa-server-setup/main/setup.sh) so that it meets your wishes :)
4. Execute the command 'chmod +x setup.sh' to give it execution permissions
5. Run './setup.sh'

---

## Afterwards?
- You now have a dockerized MOHAA server
  - Change the server configurations
  - Run it via 'docker compose up'
  - Profit?
